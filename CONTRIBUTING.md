:+1: First of all, thanks for your commitment and time :+1:

If you want to propose code changes :

1. `git clone https://github.com/Kcnarf/d3-voronoi-treemap.git`
2. `yarn install`
3. make your changes, and
   1. `yarn test` to check possible sides effects
   2. add specifications if required (new API, new behavior)
4. :warning: `yarn precommit` in order to test the whole thing and build adequate files (notably, the .min files)
5. `git commit`
6. `git push`
